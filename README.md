## Project: Deadly Dungeons

The player will have to go through the different dungeons that will be presented to him. In each one, he would have to face
enemies and defeat them to access the next level. When considering elements of bullet hell, the player will have to be skillful and manage to dodge the large number of bullets in order to survive. Along the way, you will be able to collect the weapons that the
enemies drop or heal with hearts that will appear in the game area.
